## Benchmarking
Comparative company data against peers in similar industries — use benchmarking to identify performance gaps in liquidity, profitability, and efficiency.  
Example: benchmark data for Gardner Company.

Notes:
- Keep benchmarking metrics consistent (same periods, definitions).
- Focus on DSO, DPO (Days Payable Outstanding), and Inventory Turnover when diagnosing working capital issues.

## Working Capital
Definition:
- Working Capital = Current Assets − Current Liabilities

Purpose:
- Measures short-term liquidity and the company's ability to meet near-term obligations.

Key components and drivers:
- DSO (Days Sales Outstanding): average days to collect receivables.  
  Formula: DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Credit Sales) × Days
- DPO (Days Payable Outstanding): average days to pay suppliers; trade credit can be a short-term source of financing.
- Inventory: velocity and turnover affect financing needs.
- Receivables and payables management materially affect working capital needs.

## Income Statement (P&L)
- Sales = Revenue = Income from primary operations.  
- Net Profit (Operating Income / Bottom Line) = Revenue − Expenses (including cost of goods sold, operating expenses, taxes, interest).

## EBITDA
- EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.  
- Useful proxy for operating performance and cash-generating ability before financing and accounting effects.

## Accrual vs Cash Accounting
- Cash accounting: record transactions when cash is received or paid.  
  Example: sale recorded only when customer pays.
- Accrual accounting: record revenues when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash movement.  
  Example: recognize revenue on delivery/invoice even if payment is received later.

When analyzing working capital and profitability, be aware whether figures are on a cash or accrual basis.

 A simple flow illustrating the operating cycle:
- Cash → Setup/Investment → Purchase assets/inventory → Production → Sales (on credit) → Accounts receivable → Collection → Cash

Compact flow:
- Cash → Inventory/Production → Sales (credit) → Receivables → Cash (collection)

## Practical reminders
- [x] Cash is not profit — maintain careful cash forecasts.
- Price elasticity: some businesses are insensitive to price changes; others are highly sensitive. Raising price can reduce demand depending on elasticity.
- Net Profit vs Cash Flow:
  - Transactions that increase profit but don't produce cash until later: sales / accounts receivable.
  - Transactions that reduce reported profit but don't decrease cash until later: accruals / payables.
  - Transactions that put cash in the bank but don't produce profit (at least immediately): loans.
  - Transactions that take cash from the bank and may not affect profit: loan repayments, purchase of fixed assets (machinery), etc.

## Depreciation & Amortization
- Depreciation: non-cash expense that allocates the cost of a tangible capital asset over its useful life (e.g., machinery, buildings). Common methods: straight-line, declining balance. Effect: reduces accounting profit but is added back when reconciling to operating cash flow.
- Amortization: similar allocation for intangible assets (e.g., patents, software licenses). Also non-cash and treated like depreciation for cash-flow reconciliation.
- Practical note: depreciation/amortization lower taxable income (timing depends on method) but do not directly affect cash balance; always reconcile P&L to cash flow when planning.

## Critical Performance Ratios (CPR)
- PE (Price / Earnings): Stock price ÷ Earnings per share. Guideline: often < 20 (industry dependent).
- Current Ratio: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. Guideline: ~2 for comfortable liquidity.
- Quick Ratio (Acid-test): (Current Assets − Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities. Guideline: ~1.0–1.3.
- DSO (Days Sales Outstanding): (Accounts Receivable ÷ Credit Sales) × Days in period. Guideline: 30–45 days (industry dependent).
- DPO (Days Payable Outstanding): (Accounts Payable ÷ Cost of Goods Sold) × Days in period. Use to manage supplier financing.
- Inventory Turnover: Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory. Guideline: ~7 (varies by business model).
- Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit ÷ Revenue. Typical ranges vary widely (20%–80%) by sector.
- Cost per Sales Dollar:
  - Sales & Marketing Ratio = Sales & Marketing Expense ÷ Gross Sales.
  - R&D Ratio = R&D Expense ÷ Gross Sales.
- Productivity measures:
  - Backlog = Orders received − Orders shipped/invoiced.
  - Sales per square foot, Sales per employee — use to monitor operational efficiency.
- Debt-to-Equity: Total Debt ÷ Total Equity. Guideline: < 1 for conservative leverage.
- Return on Equity (ROE): Net Income (annualized) ÷ Shareholders' Equity. Guideline: 15–20% (target varies by industry).

## Summary — key takeaways
- Benchmark consistently: compare the same periods, definitions and peer groups; focus on DSO, DPO and Inventory Turnover to diagnose working capital needs.
- Working capital = Current Assets − Current Liabilities. Manage receivables, payables and inventory to optimize financing needs and liquidity.
- Reconcile accrual P&L to cash flow: depreciation & amortization are non-cash expenses and must be added back to get operating cash flow.
- Use CPR metrics to monitor health: liquidity (Current, Quick), efficiency (DSO, Inventory Turnover), profitability (Gross Margin, ROE), and leverage (Debt-to-Equity).
- Cash ≠ profit: prioritize cash forecasting. Recognize that loans, timing of receivables/payables and capex affect cash independently of accounting profit.
- Practical checklist: maintain consistent benchmarking, stress-test cash flows, and track a small set of high-signal metrics (e.g., DSO, DPO, Inventory Turnover, Gross Margin, ROE).
