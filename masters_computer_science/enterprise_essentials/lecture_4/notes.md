# Enterprise Essentials — Lecture 4 Notes

## Overview
Concise definitions and frameworks to understand firm structures, value chains, industry evolution, commerce types, and services.

## Model
A three-dimensional representation of a person, thing, or proposed structure, typically on a smaller scale than the original.

## The Firm
### Vertical view (hierarchy)
- Two prevailing hierarchical models:
  - U-Form — Unitary form
  - M-Form — Multidivisional form

### Horizontal view (value chain)
- A firm can be described as a value chain: activities performed to design, produce, market, deliver, and support a product.

## Traditional Industries — Evolution
- Phase 1
  - Just-in-time production
  - Total quality management
  - Outsource non-core activities
- Phase 2
  - Personalization
  - Servitization (embedding services into products)
  - Social and environmental responsibility: localization and shorter supply chains

## Enterprise Types — Commerce
1. B2B — Business to Business
2. B2C — Business to Consumer

## Commerce — Evolution
- Phase 1
  - E‑commerce: buying and selling online
  - Customer segmentation: targeting specific customer groups
- Phase 2
  - Phygital commerce: integration of physical and digital experiences
  - Focus on customer experience across channels and the customer journey

## Services — Evolution (Financial Services, IT, Consulting)
- Phase 1
  - Considered the "poor relation" (outsourcing non-core functions)
  - Complementary services added to core offerings
  - Often optional
- Phase 2
  - Customer-centric approach
  - Product–service continuum
  - Services as core offerings

## Information Technology — Services & Evolution
- Common service domains:
  - Advertising
  - Media
- Evolution of IT services
  - Phase 1
    - Broadcasting
    - "Gatekeepers" model
  - Phase 2
    - User-generated content
    - Peer-to-peer exchanges
    - "Attention economy"
    - Convergence of information, entertainment, and advertising

## Goods vs Services
- Tangible goods (products)
  - Physical items that can be touched and owned
- Intangible goods (services)
  - Non-physical offerings that cannot be touched or owned
  - Examples: software, digital content, consulting services

## Major determinants of modern corporate structures
- Geography/Region
- Product or Service Line
- Client/Customer Segment
- Function/Department, Competency Skill

## Enterprise Models
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
- Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)
- Infrastructure Management

## Pricing(and Prices)
At the heart of any business model is the pricing model, which defines how a company charges for its products or services. 

**Revenue-generating models** include:
- Subscription-based pricing
- Transaction-based pricing
- License-based pricing
- Commission-based pricing
- Advertising-based pricing
- Capacity-based pricing
- Trading-based pricing
- Subsidy-based pricing

## Illustration of Digital technologies and price sensitivity
In principle, digital technologies enable a wide variety of pricing models, including dynamic pricing, freemium models, and usage-based pricing.
Allow businesses to tailor their pricing strategies to customer needs and market conditions.

## The Business Model
Wikipedia definition: A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of business model construction is part of business strategy. In theory and practice, the term business model is used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business, including purpose, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, trading practices, and operational processes and policies.

## The Business Model Canvas
Reorganized into five regions as requested: top-left, top-right, middle, bottom-left, bottom-right.

**Top left**
- Key Partnerships — the external organizations or entities that help the business achieve its objectives
- Key Activities — the essential actions the business must take to operate successfully
- Key Resources — the critical assets required to deliver the value proposition

**Top right**
- Customer Segments — who the business serves
- Channels — how the business delivers its value proposition
- Customer Relationships — the type of relationship the business establishes with its customers

**Middle**
- Value Propositions — the unique value offered to customers

**Bottom left**
- Cost Structure — the major costs incurred by the business in delivering its value proposition

**Bottom right**
- Revenue Streams — how the business generates income


## Support Functions Finance & Accounting
Finance deals with the management of assets and liabilities and the planning of future growth. Accounting focuses on the accurate recording and reporting of financial transactions.

## Finance & Accounting Cost Management
- Average Cost -> the total cost divided by the number of goods produced
- Fixed Cost -> costs that do not change with the level of output
- Variable Cost -> costs that vary directly with the level of output
- Marginal Cost -> the cost of producing one additional unit of output

## Finally, from a time perspective:
- Short-term costs -> costs that vary with production levels in the short term
- Long-term costs -> costs that can be adjusted in the long term, including fixed costs

## CAPEX vs OPEX
- CAPEX (Capital Expenditures) -> funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment
- OPEX (Operational Expenditures) -> ongoing costs for running a product, business, or system.

## Finance & Accounting On Costs
Whatever happens, i.e. an enterprise makes a profit or a loss, costs are incurred. Costs can be broadly classified into:

## Two key performance indicators would be then:
1. Variables Cost Ratio = VCM = (R - VC) / R
2. Break-even Point = BEP = R / VCM

Where R = Revenue, VC = Variable Costs

- Measures profitablity through variable costs and revenue
- P&L formula: M = R - VC - FC = (R-C)/R
  - M = Margin (Profit or Loss)
  - R = Revenue
  - VC = Variable Costs
  - FC = Fixed Costs
