# Enterprise Essentials — Lecture 4 Notes

## Overview
Concise definitions and frameworks to understand firm structures, value chains, industry evolution, commerce types, and services.

## Model
A three-dimensional representation of a person, thing, or proposed structure, typically on a smaller scale than the original.

## The Firm
### Vertical view (hierarchy)
- Two prevailing hierarchical models:
  - U-Form — Unitary form
  - M-Form — Multidivisional form

### Horizontal view (value chain)
- A firm can be described as a value chain: activities performed to design, produce, market, deliver, and support a product.

## Traditional Industries — Evolution
- Phase 1
  - Just-in-time production
  - Total quality management
  - Outsource non-core activities

## Pricing(and Prices)
At the heart of any business model is the pricing model, which defines how a company charges for its products or services. 

**Revenue-generating models** include:
- Subscription-based pricing
- Transaction-based pricing
- License-based pricing
- Commission-based pricing
- Advertising-based pricing
- Capacity-based pricing
- Trading-based pricing
- Subsidy-based pricing

## Illustration of Digital technologies and price sensitivity
In principle, digital technologies enable a wide variety of pricing models, including dynamic pricing, freemium models, and usage-based pricing.
Allow businesses to tailor their pricing strategies to customer needs and market conditions.

## The Business Model
Wikipedia definition: A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of business model construction is part of business strategy. In theory and practice, the term business model is used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business, including purpose, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, trading practices, and operational processes and policies.
