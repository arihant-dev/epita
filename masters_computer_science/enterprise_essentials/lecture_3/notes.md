## The Five Stages of Small Business Growth (Churchill & Lewis)
1. **Existence** — Getting customers and delivering the product/service; primary challenge: survival.
2. **Survival** — Cash flow and basic systems; focus on breaking even and stabilizing.
3. **Success** — Profitable and stable; decision point: maintain a small profitable business or prepare for growth.
4. **Take-off (Growth)** — Rapid expansion; need for formal organization and outside capital.
5. **Resource Maturity** — Complex structures, formal management systems, diversified resources.

**Management implication:** each stage brings different leadership needs, structure, and financing requirements.

## Market Growth vs Company Growth
- **Market growth:** total demand for a product/service increases (industry-level).
- **Company growth:** a firm's share of revenue/customers increases.
- **Strategy difference:** capture growing market vs gain share in a stable market (requires competitive advantage).

## Startup → Grown-up (transition)
- **Characteristics of startup:** flexibility, founder-driven, fast iteration, informal processes.
- **Characteristics of grown-up:** formal processes, delegated management, scalable systems.
- **Key transition tasks:** document core processes, hire managers, introduce finance and HR controls.

## Creativity → Direction (leadership shift)
- **Early phase:** creativity, improvisation, founder-led decisions.
- **Later phase:** need for direction, planning, measurable objectives, and systemization.
- **Common friction:** founders must move from doing to leading.

## Bouygues — example
- Bouygues started in construction and diversified into media and telecoms.
- Use-case: example of strategic diversification and vertical/horizontal moves to manage growth and risk.

## Local Markets vs Global Markets
- **Local:** focus on proximity, local regulation, cultural fit, logistics.
- **Global:** scale advantages, broader customer base, cross-border regulation, higher complexity.
- **Entry considerations:** local partnerships, adaptation, compliance, supply chain resilience.

## Company Growth: Internal (endogenous) vs External (exogenous)
- **Internal (organic):** grow by reinvesting profits, scaling operations, R&D.
  - **Pros:** control, cultural consistency, lower integration risk.
  - **Cons:** slower, capital constraints.
- **External:** mergers & acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures.
  - **Pros:** faster scale, access to new markets/technology.
  - **Cons:** integration risk, cultural clashes, higher upfront cost.

## Diminishing Returns vs Increasing Returns
- Quote (corrected attribution): "Diminishing returns hold sway in the traditional part of the economy — the processing industries. Increasing returns reign in the newer part — the knowledge-based industries." — W. Brian Arthur (1996).
- **Diminishing returns:** added input yields progressively smaller output gains (typical in manufacturing).
- **Increasing returns:** scale or network effects lead to disproportionately larger gains as size grows (typical in information, platforms, and knowledge industries).
- **Implication:** strategy differs — optimize efficiency in diminishing-return sectors; focus on scale/network effects in increasing-return sectors.

## Vertical Integration vs Horizontal Integration
- **Vertical integration:** control more stages of the value chain (e.g., manufacturer buys supplier).
  - **Pros:** control over inputs/quality, margin capture.
  - **Cons:** capital intensive, less flexibility.
- **Horizontal integration:** acquire or merge with competitors or adjacent product lines.
  - **Pros:** market share, economies of scale, diversification.
  - **Cons:** antitrust risk, integration difficulties.

## Quick practical notes
- Always map which stage of growth a firm is in before proposing organizational changes.
- Choose growth mode (internal vs external) based on speed required, capital, and cultural fit.
- For knowledge-based firms, prioritize mechanisms that amplify increasing returns (networks, platforms, learning).
