# Enterprise Essentials - Key Concepts & Definitions for MCQ Preparation

## **FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS**

**Economic Agent**
An entity (individual, firm, government) that participates in economic activities by producing, consuming, or exchanging goods and services.

**Economic Value**
A measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent; created when needs are satisfied through transformation of resources into products/services.

**Value Creation Process**
Three steps: (1) Satisfying needs of people, (2) Transforming resources into products/services through work, (3) Exchanging/distributing between producers and users.

**Industry**
A group of production activities classified according to the good or service provided; defines companies working in the same domain.

**Market**
An exchange mechanism bringing together buyers and sellers; where prices are established through transactions.

**Supply Chain**
The system and resources required to move a product/service from supplier to customer; includes all transformation steps.

**Value Chain**
Activities performed to design, produce, market, deliver, and support a product; shows how value is added at each stage (Michael Porter concept).

## **PORTER'S FIVE FORCES**

**Industry Rivalry**
Competition among firms providing similar goods/services to the same market; intensity determines competitive dynamics.

**Threat of New Entrants**
Possibility of new companies entering the market to compete with incumbents; depends on barriers to entry.

**Barriers to Entry**
Anything preventing new entrants into a market: regulations, capital requirements, know-how, customer loyalty, licenses, etc.

**Threat of Substitutes**
Products/services from other markets that can replace existing offerings (e.g., streaming vs. DVD, paper cup vs. china cup).

**Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
Suppliers' ability to influence prices and terms; stronger when few suppliers exist or products are specialized.

**Bargaining Power of Buyers**
Buyers' ability to lower prices or demand better quality/service; stronger with buyer concentration or many suppliers.

---

## **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE**

**Competitive Advantage**
A condition putting a company in favorable/superior business position versus competitors.

**Three Sources (Porter):**
1. **Cost Advantage** - Lower production costs due to scale/efficiency
2. **Differentiation Advantage** - Superior quality or unique features
3. **Specialization (Niche Focus)** - Excellence in specific market segment

**Economies of Scale**
Cost advantages from size/output; cost per unit decreases as production increases (internal or external).

**Economies of Scope**
Cost advantages from diversification; producing multiple products together costs less than separately (Panzar & Willig).

## **BUSINESS GROWTH**

**Five Stages of Small Business Growth (Churchill & Lewis):**
1. **Existence** - Getting customers, survival challenge
2. **Survival** - Cash flow management, breaking even
3. **Success** - Decision point: maintain or grow
4. **Take-off** - Rapid expansion, needs formal organization
5. **Resource Maturity** - Complex structures, formal systems

**Market Growth**
Total demand for product/service increases at industry level; measured by overall sales volume growth.

**Company Growth**
A firm's increasing share of revenue/customers; can occur through market expansion or gaining share in stable markets.

**Internal (Endogenous) Growth**
Organic growth by reinvesting profits, scaling operations, R&D; slower but maintains control and culture.

**External (Exogenous) Growth**
Growth through mergers & acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures; faster but involves integration risks.

**Vertical Integration**
Controlling more stages of the value chain (e.g., manufacturer buys supplier); increases control but capital intensive.

**Horizontal Integration**
Acquiring competitors or adjacent product lines; increases market share and economies of scale.

**Diminishing Returns**
Each additional input yields progressively smaller output gains; typical in traditional manufacturing/processing industries.

**Increasing Returns**
Scale/network effects lead to disproportionately larger gains; typical in knowledge-based/platform industries (W. Brian Arthur).

## **INNOVATION TYPES**

**Innovation (Schumpeter)**
Process of creative destruction where new products/processes replace old ones, driving economic growth.

**Innovation (Drucker)**
Change that creates a new dimension of performance; specific instrument of entrepreneurship.

**Routine (Incremental) Innovation**
Improving existing products/services/processes continuously; "bread and butter" of companies; requires continuous improvement (TQM).
