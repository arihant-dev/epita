## Management at CrossRoads
- Economics
- Sociology
- Technology
- Psychology

## Management and economics
- Type of major influences of economics :-
    - The  <<invisible hand>> of market forces (Adam Smith)
    - The relationship between capital and labour (Karl Marx)
    - The role of the state (John Maynard Keynes)
    - The role of the innovative company and of the enterpreneur (Joseph Schumpeter)

## Management and sociology
- In this approach, the business organization is seen as a social system made up of individuals and groups with their own roles, norms, and values.
- Bureaucracy (Max Weber) - The organizational structure characterized by formal rules, hierarchical authority, and impersonal relationships.
 - In Weber's view, bureaucracy is the most efficient and rational way to organize large-scale enterprises.
- Scientific Management (Frederick Taylor) - Focuses on improving efficiency through scientific analysis of work processes and tasks.
- Administrative Management (Henri Fayol) - Emphasizes the importance of management functions such as planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling.
- Human Relations (Elton Mayo) - Emphasizes the importance of social interactions and employee well-being in the workplace.
- The top-down approach - Management makes decisions and passes them down to employees.

## Management and cognitive psychology
- An organization may be considered as a problem-solving entity.
- However, human rationality is limited in nature, one speaks of <<bounded rationality>> (Herbert Simon)
 - According to Simons, a manager's cognitive limitations prevent them from making fully rational decisions.
- Furthermore, an organization may be seen as a set of individuals or group of individuals with a common goal.
 - This goal-oriented view of organizations is often associated with systems theory and cybernetics (Norbert Wiener)
 - In this perspective, an organization is seen as a system that processes information and feedback to achieve its goals.

 ## Management and technolgy
- The socio-technical systems approach - Emphasizes the interdependence between social and technical aspects of an organization.
 - This approach recognizes that technology can impact social relationships and vice versa.
- Technology as a driver of organizational change - New technologies can lead to changes in organizational structure,

# Change Management
## Position and Paradigms
- Position Innovations: Focus on changing the position of products or services in the market to better meet customer needs or tap into new markets.
- Paradigm Innovations: Involve fundamental changes to the underlying principles or business models of an organization, often leading to significant shifts in how value is created and delivered.

## Coordination types(according to H Mintzberg)
1. Simple Coordination - Direct supervision where one individual oversees the work of others.
2. Mechanistic Bureaucracy - Standardization of work processes through established procedures and rules.
3. Divisional structure - Coordination through the division of labor into semi-autonomous units or divisions.
4. Professional bureaucracy - Standardization of skills and knowledge through formal education and training.
5. Adhocracy - Coordination through mutual adjustment and collaboration among individuals and teams.

## Heirachal Organizations
- Characterized by a clear chain of command and hierarchical structure.
- Decision-making authority is concentrated at the top levels of management.
- Communication flows vertically through the organization.

## Matrix Organizations
- Combines functional and project-based structures.
- Employees report to both functional managers and project managers.
- Facilitates collaboration and resource sharing across different departments.
- Due to double reporting lines, can lead to confusion and conflicts in authority.

## Organnization by Projects
- Focuses on project-based work, with teams formed around specific projects.
- Teams are often cross-functional, bringing together individuals with diverse skills and expertise.
- Emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to changing project requirements.
- The PMO (Project Management Office) is a centralized unit that oversees project management practices, standards, and governance within an organization. The PMO provides support, guidance, and resources to project teams to ensure successful project delivery and alignment with organizational goals.

## CHange Management
- Luc de Brabandere's Change Management Model
1. Recognize the need for change
2. Create a vision for change
3. Communicate the vision
4. Empower employees to act on the vision
5. Create short-term wins
6. Consolidate gains and produce more change
7. Anchor new approaches in the organization's culture

## Barriers to Change and Innovation
- Bureaucratic Inertia - Resistance to change due to established procedures and routines. Leadership, Incentive, Collaboration, Resources, Culture
- Fear of the Unknown - Anxiety about potential negative consequences of change.
- Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma - Established companies may struggle to adopt disruptive innovations that initially serve niche markets, leading to missed opportunities for growth and adaptation.
- The competency trap - Organizations may become overly reliant on existing competencies and fail to adapt to changing market conditions or technological advancements, leading to stagnation and decline.
- Knowledge may not act as a barrier to learning (Starbucks 1983) - When organizations assume that their existing knowledge and expertise are sufficient, they may resist learning new approaches or adopting innovative practices, hindering their ability to adapt and grow in a dynamic business environment.

## Change via Projects(Programs)
- Implementing a "Project Mode" within an organization involves adopting a structured approach to managing and executing projects to achieve specific goals and objectives. This approach emphasizes the importance of project management principles, methodologies, and best practices to ensure successful project delivery.

## Change within the change
### Team Roles
R - Responsible
A - Accountable
C - Consulted
I - Informed

- Roles may vary based on the nature of the project and the organization's structure.
