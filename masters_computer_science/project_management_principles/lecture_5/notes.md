## Project Management Principles - Lecture 5 Notes

## S Curve
- A graphical representation of cumulative costs, labor hours, or other quantities plotted against time.
- Typically used to monitor project progress and performance.
- The S-curve shape reflects the slow start, rapid progress, and eventual leveling off of project activities.

## Planned Value (PV)
- The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work to be accomplished for a specific time period.
- Also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS).
- Used to measure project performance against the project schedule.
## Earned Value (EV)
- The value of work actually performed expressed in terms of the approved budget assigned to that work.
- Also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).
- Used to assess project performance and progress.
- Calculation Plan:
  - EV = (Percent Complete) x (Total Project Budget)
## Actual Cost (AC)
- The total cost incurred for the work performed during a specific time period.
- Also known as Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).
- Used to compare against planned value and earned value to evaluate cost performance.
## Cost Variance (CV)
- A measure of cost performance on a project.
- Calculated as CV = EV - AC.
- A positive CV indicates a cost underrun, while a negative CV indicates a cost overrun.
## Schedule Variance (SV)
- A measure of schedule performance on a project.
- Calculated as SV = EV - PV.
- A positive SV indicates ahead of schedule, while a negative SV indicates behind schedule.

## Example

Total Budget = 400k
Duration = 4 Months

After 3 Months:
EV = 100K
AC = 200k

CV = EV - AC = 100k - 200k = -100k (over budget)
SV = EV - PV = 100k - 300k = -200k (behind schedule)

## Performance Indices
- Cost Performance Index (CPI): A measure of cost efficiency of budgeted resources. Calculated as CPI = EV / AC.
    - A CPI value greater than 1 indicates cost efficiency, while a value less than 1 indicates cost overruns.
- Schedule Performance Index (SPI): A measure of schedule efficiency. Calculated as SPI = EV / PV.
    - An SPI value greater than 1 indicates ahead of schedule, while a value less than 1 indicates delays.

## Achieving a balance means minimizing the resource waste while maximizing the resource use.

## Forecast Values
- BAC (Budget at Completion): The total budget allocated for the project.
- EAC (Estimate at Completion): The expected total cost of the project at completion.
    - EAC = BAC / CPI
- ETC (Estimate to Complete): The expected cost to finish all remaining project work.
    - ETC = EAC - AC
- VAC (Variance at Completion): The expected variance between the budget at completion and the estimate at completion.
    - VAC = BAC - EAC

## Example (daily-rate scenario — clarified)

- Daily rate: 1000 Euro per day
- Project duration: 6 days (so BAC = 6 * 1000 = 6000 Euro)
- After 3 days:
  - PV (BCWS) = 3 * 1000 = 3000 Euro

Tasks (showing full budget, % complete, EV contribution, AC contribution):
- Task 1: Budget = 1200, % complete = 100% → EV = 1200, AC = 1200
- Task 2: Budget = 1000, % complete = 100% → EV = 1000, AC = 1000
- Task 3: Budget = 1000, % complete = 75%  → EV = 750,  AC = 750
- Task 4: Budget = 600,  % complete = 50%  → EV = 300,  AC = 600
- Task 5: Budget = 1100, % complete = 0%   → EV = 0,    AC = 0
- Task 6: Budget = 1100, % complete = 0%   → EV = 0,    AC = 0

Calculations:
- BAC = 6000 Euro
- PV (BCWS) = 3000 Euro
- EV (BCWP) = 1200 + 1000 + 750 + 300 + 0 + 0 = 3250 Euro
- AC (ACWP) = 1200 + 1000 + 750 + 400 + 0 + 0 = 3450 Euro

- EC = EV - AC = 3250 - 3450 = -200 Euro
- SV = EV - PV = 3250 - 3000 = 250 Euro

- CPI = EV / AC = 3250 / 3450 = 0.942
- SPI = EV / PV = 3250 / 3000 = 1.083
- EAC = BAC / CPI = 6000 / 0.942 = 6360.64 Euro
- ETC = EAC - AC = 6360.64 - 3450 = 2910.64 Euro
- VAC = BAC - EAC = 6000 - 6360.64 = -360.64 Euro


### Quality Management

# Triangle of Quality Management
- Scope
- Time
- Cost

# Triple Constraint
- Quality
- Time
- Cost

# Important points in QM
- Customer satisfaction is the ultimate goal
- Prevention over inspection
- Continuous improvement(Kaizen)
  - Based on Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle
- Quality is everyone's responsibility
- Use of statistical methods for quality control
- Focus on processes to improve quality

# Definition of Quality
- The international Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines quality as "the extent to which a set of intrinsic characteristics fulfills requirements."

# Shewhart and Deming Cycle (PDCA Cycle)
The PDCA cycle is a four-step iterative process for continuous improvement of processes and products.
1. Plan: Identify an opportunity for improvement and plan a change.
2. Do: Implement the change on a small scale.
3. Check: Use data to analyze the results of the change and determine whether it made a difference.
4. Act: If the change was successful, implement it on a wider scale and continuously assess your results. If the change did not work, begin the cycle again.
# Benefits of PDCA Cycle
- Encourages continuous improvement
- Reduces risks by testing changes on a small scale first
- Promotes data-driven decision making
- Involves all team members in the improvement process
