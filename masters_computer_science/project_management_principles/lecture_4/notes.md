# Project Management Principles - Lecture 4 Notes

## Cost Management

The process of estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget.

Value engineering: looking for less expensive ways to do the same job with the same content

Law of diminishing returns: after a certain point, adding more resources results in smaller increases in output

## Type of costs
- Variable costs
- Fixed costs
- Direct costs
- Indirect costs

## Quality and accuracy of the cost estimate
- Rough order of Magnitude (ROM): -25% to +75%
- Budgetary Estimate: -10% to +25%
- Definitive Estimate: -5% to +10%

## Estimating methods
- Estimating by analogy
- Ascending estimate
- Expert judgement
- Delphi
- Analysis of suppliers

## Costs consolidation
- Provisions for risks are important for budget preparation
-> Known unknowns(contingency reserves): Contingency reserves
-> Unknown unknowns(discretionary reserves): Management reserves: Discretionary reserves
