# Copilot Instructions for Project Management Principles Notes

## Project Context
This workspace contains educational notes for a Project Management Principles course. The content is organized by lecture, with each lecture covering specific project management concepts and frameworks.

## Content Structure & Conventions

### Note Organization
- **File naming**: `notes.md` contains lecture content
- **Current focus**: Lecture 2 covers leadership styles and team management responsibilities
- **Content format**: Bullet-point style notes with clear categorization

### Writing Style Patterns
Based on `notes.md`, follow these conventions:
- Use **bold headers** with dashes underneath for main topics (e.g., "Types of Leaders", "Responsibilities")
- Use **bullet points** (`-`) for listing concepts, not numbered lists
- **Leadership examples**: Include real-world leaders in parentheses after definitions
  - Format: `[Leader Type] - [description]; [Example 1], [Example 2]`
  - Example: `Transformational Leaders - want to build up the moral...; Steve Jobs, Gandhi`
- Keep descriptions concise and practical, focusing on "when to use" guidance
- Maintain consistent indentation for sub-points

### Content Guidelines
- **Incomplete sections**: Notes may contain incomplete sentences (e.g., "Democratic Leaders - involves actively seeking inputs/feedbacks from team members before making decisions; if you know if they are highly skilled") - preserve the informal, in-progress nature
- **Vocabulary**: Use project management terminology correctly (e.g., "moral" should likely be "morale", but preserve original intent unless explicitly correcting)
- **Examples are critical**: Always include real-world leader examples when adding new leadership types or management concepts

## AI Agent Workflow
When updating or expanding these notes:
1. Maintain the bullet-point structure for readability
2. Add real-world examples for abstract concepts
3. Include "when to use" context for frameworks or leadership types
4. Keep language direct and student-friendly
5. Preserve the informal, note-taking style rather than making it overly formal
